# Eye Disease Classification using Retinal Fundus Images

This project focuses on the classification of eye diseases using retinal fundus images. The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically **EfficientNetB3**, which is well-suited for medical image classification due to its efficiency and accuracy. The model was retrained on a custom dataset with some modifications to the original code, and a simple web interface was built using Flask to allow users to upload or drag-and-drop eye images for disease prediction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify eye diseases from retinal fundus images. The model was initially developed by another [developer](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdallahwagih/eye-diseases-classification-acc-93-8), and I retrained it with a new dataset, made some modifications, and deployed it using a Flask web interface. The model achieves an accuracy of **0.95** on the testing dataset, but its performance in real-world applications may vary depending on factors like image quality, illumination, and data augmentation.

Hereâ€™s a concise section you can add to your `README.md` to showcase the images of your project:

## Model Details

### Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset of retinal fundus images of Kaggle. The dataset includes images of various eye diseases, and the model was retrained to improve its performance on this specific data.

### Model Architecture
The model uses **EfficientNetB3** as the backbone for feature extraction. This architecture is particularly effective for medical image classification due to its ability to handle complex patterns in images with high accuracy.

### Training and Evaluation
- **Training**: The model was retrained with a custom dataset, and data augmentation techniques were applied to improve generalization.
- **Evaluation**: The model achieved an accuracy of **0.95** on the testing dataset. However, real-world performance may vary due to differences in image quality and illumination.

### Limitations
- The model may struggle with images that have significantly different illumination or quality compared to the training data.
- Further improvements can be made by incorporating more diverse data and advanced augmentation techniques.

## Web Interface

A simple web interface was built using **Flask** to allow users to interact with the model. Users can upload or drag-and-drop retinal fundus images, and the model will predict the corresponding eye disease.

### How to Use the Web Interface
1. Launch the Flask application.
2. Open the web interface in your browser.
3. Upload or drag-and-drop a retinal fundus image.
4. The model will process the image and display the predicted disease.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the original work by **[Abdallah Wagih Ibrahim](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdallahwagih/eye-diseases-classification-acc-93-8)**. The original code includes functions for:
- Creating a dataframe from the dataset.
- Data augmentation.
- Displaying data samples.
- Personalized callbacks during training.
- Plotting training history and confusion matrix.

I retrained the model with a new dataset, made modifications, and built the Flask web interface for deployment.
